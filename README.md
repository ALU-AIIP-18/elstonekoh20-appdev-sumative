# elstonekoh20-appdev-sumative
Summative Assessment for the AppDev Module in AIIP
 FILES
 app.py
 dashboard.py
 apicalls.py
 
 To run app use app.py
 
 ISSUES:
1. Dash starts when flask starts hence uploaded maintenance file only used after a rerun of application
 
2. 7Timer API not updated daily. Hence datenow could not be used as reference for displaying tommorrow, next tommorrow, ... to prevent errors. Rather simple list indexing was done
